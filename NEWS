  - No change in the code.
  - Fixed spelling errors in the man page.

Version 1.1.0 (2012-05-03)
  - Beta release. All features should be considered relatively
    stable unless explicitely stated otherwise.
  - Added proper command line handling and help.
  - Added the possibility to overwrite the input file
    when the output file is not specified or when both files
    are physically the same.

    It is now the official way to build flvmeta on Windows.

    flvdump functionality into flvmeta.
  - Added support for XML, YAML, and JSON formats for dumping.
  - Added XML schemas describing the various formats used by flvmeta.
  - Added a file checking feature.
  - Added the possibility to print output file metadata after
    a successful update using one of the supported formats.
  - Added a feature to insert custom metadata strings while updating.
  - Added an option to disable insertion of the onLastSecond event.
  - Added an option to preserve existing metadata tags if possible.
  - Added an option to fix invalid tags while updating (this is
    a highly experimental feature, should be used with caution)
  - Added an option to ignore invalid tags as much as possible
    instead of exiting at the first error detected.
  - Added an option to reset the file timestamps in order to
    correctly start at zero, for example if the file has been
    incorrectly split by buggy tools.
  - Added an option to display informative messages while processing
    (not quite exhaustive for the moment).
  - Changed keyframe index generation so only the first keyframe
    for a given timestamp will be indexed. This behaviour can be
    overriden with the --all-keyframes/-k option.

Version 1.0.11 (2010-01-25)
  - Bug fix release.
  - Fixed video resolution detection when the first video frame
    is not a keyframe.
  - Fixed invalid timestamp handling in the case of decreasing timestamps.
  - Fixed AVC resolution computation when frame cropping rectangle
    is used.
  - Fixed handling of files with a non-zero starting timestamp.
  - Fixed datasize tag computation so only metadata are taken
    into account.

Version 1.0.10 (2009-09-02)
  - Bug fix release.
  - Fixed amf_data_dump numeric format.

  - Bug fix release.
  - Fixed large file support so it will work for files bigger than 4GB.
  - Fixed date handling in AMF according to the official spec.

  - Fixed a bug causing reading invalid tags to potentially lead to
    memory overflow and creation of invalid files.

Version 1.0.8 (2009-05-08)
  - Added support for arbitrary large files (2GB+).
  - Added support for AVC (H.264) video resolution detection.
  - Added support for the Speex codec and rarely met video frame types.
  - Fixed a bug where two consecutive tags of different types and
    with decreasing timestamps would cause extended timestamps
    to be incorrectly used for the next tags.
  - Fixed a bug where zero would be used as video height and width
    if video resolution could not be detected.
  - Fixed a bug causing flvdump to crash after reading invalid tags.
    Flvdump now exits after the first invalid tag read.

Version 1.0.7 (2008-09-25)
  - Added support for extended timestamps.
    Now flvmeta can read and write FLV files longer than 4:39:37,
    as well as fix files with incorrect timestamps.
