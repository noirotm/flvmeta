This is FLVmeta, a metadata injector for Adobe(r) FLV video files.

The package contains an utility, flvmeta, to inject an onMetaData event in FLV
files, as well as the onLastSecond event, and to print all informations about
an input FLV file.

The flvmeta utility is able to compute almost all known metadata tags,
including the keyframes list.
As of version 1.0.7, it is also able to fix very large FLV files with
invalid 24-bit only timestamps to make proper use of 32-bit extended
timestamps.
As of version 1.0.8, it can handle arbitrarily large files.

The main goal of this program is to write an alternative to tools like flvtool2.
It is written in portable C, and should compile on most platforms (it has
been successfully compiled and tested on Ubuntu Feisty, MacOSX 10.4, and
Windows XP).
FLVmeta is fast and has a very small memory footprint.
